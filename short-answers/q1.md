# Question
In what situations is a `while` loop better than a `for` loop?

# Answer
When you do not know the number of iterations necessary, it is better to use a "while" loop than a "for loop." For example, in a list of names, you are looking for a specific name; however, you do not know the amount of names on the list. In this case, it would be better to use a "while" loop as it would allow for continuous iteration until the name is found.
