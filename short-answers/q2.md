# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
Yes, we could incorporate the if statement in the for loop: 
```
for (let i = 0; i <= 7; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
Since it states if (i > 7), I am assuming that it will be inclusive of 7.
